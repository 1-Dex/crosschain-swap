# Crosschain Asset Transfer Solidity Code

This Solidity smart contract facilitates crosschain asset transfers using ZetaChain's Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) addresses and ZRC-20 tokens. 

## How it Works

- **Asset Transfers**: On a connected chain, a user can transfer an asset to a ZetaChain address, known as a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) address.

- **ZRC-20 Tokens**: Assets transferred to a TSS address on ZetaChain are represented as ZRC-20 tokens, an extension of ERC-20.

## Supported Features

This contract currently supports the following omnichain features:

1. **Transfer of Native Gas Assets**: You can transfer native gas assets like ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc. between connected chains.

2. **Transfer of ERC-20 Tokens**: You can transfer ERC-20 tokens between connected chains.

With omnichain smart contracts, you can pair and trade native asset liquidity directly against each other, streamlining asset exchanges.

## Liquidity Pools

Liquidity pools are a fundamental part of ZetaChain's ecosystem, enhancing user experience and supporting various financial applications while reducing fees. ZetaChain's pools can be categorized into three main types: core ZETA pools, additional zEVM pools, and external ZETA pools.

## Getting Started

To use this contract:

1. Deploy the Solidity contract on your chosen chain with ZetaChain integration.
2. Follow the contract's instructions to transfer assets and perform crosschain operations.
